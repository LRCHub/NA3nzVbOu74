You and me are never gonna be right
So don't wait up late for me tonight
This is one of those
We can't push outta the way

We can fight our demons till we're blue in the hands
But darling I won't be doing that
Cause it's time now love
To move right on in the grave

So keep your head high Bella Mae
Save your crying for another day

We had the world in our heavy hands
We'll never have that time again
So move along tonight
But don't sit around by the phone

You and me were always running behind
Now I know we're outta time
And it's the only way
And deep down darling you know

So keep your head high Bella Mae
Save your crying for another day
So keep your head high Bella Mae
Save your crying for another day

You and me we had a one night stand
And time ran out on our master plan
But it's gone tonight
We ain't got nothing to say

You and me are never gonna be right
So don't wait up late for me tonight
This is one of those
We can't push outta the way

So keep your head high Bella Mae
Save your crying for another day
So keep your head high Bella Mae
Save your crying for another day
