Don't cry little girl
'Cause he don't walk with you now
And he don't talk with you now
Well, you got to take it somehow

Now don't cry, little girl
'Cause he's not with you today
You know you can't run away
He's gonna need you someday

So hold your head high
When he passes you by
You know he's your guy
So hold your head hi-high

Come on and smile, little girl
You've got to put on a show
And don't let anyone know
Just how he's hurtin' you so

Come on hold your head high
When he passes you by
You know he's your guy
So hold your head up hi-high

Oh-oh-oh, hold your head high
When he passes you by
Girl, you know he's your guy
Come on, come on
Hold your head, hold your head high

Hold your head high
When he passes you by
You know he's your guy
